However, a significant amount of physical effort and natural raw materials are required to produce concrete. In addition, the curing period of concrete for at least 28 days is a must for attaining the required compressive strength. Various types of industrial and agricultural wastes have been used in concrete to reduce cement consumption and problems due to its production. Therefore, considering such constraints, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the current scenarios to predict the desired output parameters. In the present study, 12 input parameters have been considered along with 455 data points and nine Machine Learning (ML) models to forecast the compressive strength of Fly Ash (FA) based concrete. The output from the models has been compared to find the best-fit model in terms of numerous analyses such as visual descriptive statistics, errors, </span><em style=""color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:'ltr-font';font-size:14px;text-align:justify;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"">R<span style=""font-size:10.5px;line-height:0;vertical-align:baseline;"">2</span></em><span style=""color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:'ltr-font';font-size:14px;text-align:justify;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"">, Taylor’s diagram, Feature Importance (FI), and scatter plots.

IJCSE LITERATURE REVIEW ON APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO DIAGNOSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ( ASD),@,"<div>Clinical decision support systems are computer based automated systems developed with the aid of AI and ML for supporting and improving the accuracy of clinical decision-making processes. These systems are used by clinicians in making diagnostic decisions and treatment plans. It is able to simulate expertise and express logical reasoning for making assertions. Many inexperienced clinicians are not well confident in certain autistic cases because their observed diagnosis and the calculated grade may not be always similar. Availability of diagnostic experts to provide clinical expertise is also a problem in the diagnosis of autism children. Hence, there is a need of a computer assist system comprised of experience and skill of a clinician, which can advance the power of existing diagnostic method. The computer-assisted system will help to confirm the assessment decisions of clinicians. Research works about the application of machine learning techniques for the development of autism assessment and grading in this area is very much required. This work proposes an approach which uses machine learning techniques for autism grading.</div>","['iasetjournal', 'journals']",https://archive.org/download/05-05-2020-1588664634-6-ijcse-3.-ijcse-literature-review-on-applying-machine-lea/05-05-2020-1588664634-6-%20IJCSE-3.%20IJCSE-LITERATURE%20REVIEW%20ON%20APPLYING%20MACHINE%20LEARNING%20TECHNIQUES%20TO%20DIAGNOSE%20AUTISM%20SPECTRUM%20DISORDER%20%28ASD%29.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white-hat-security-ai-human-element-study,The AI and Human Element Security Sentiment Study,W,"<h3>How Two Powerful Forces Can Tackle Our Biggest Application Security Challenges</h3>
<p>The “AI and Human Element Security Sentiment Study” is based on a 
survey of 102 industry professionals at the RSA Conference 2020. The 
research revealed that while over half of organizations use artificial 
intelligence (AI) or machine learning in their security stack, nearly 60
 percent are still more confident in cyberthreat findings verified by 
humans over AI.<br /><br />The survey responses, along with the theme of 
“Human Element” at RSA Conference 2020, reflect the need for security 
organizations to incorporate both AI- and human-centric offerings, 
especially in the application security space. Three-quarters of 
respondents use an application security tool, and more than 40 percent 
of those application security solutions use both AI-based and 
human-based verification.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Download this security report to learn:<br /></p>

classifying a set of text documents automatically into different categories 
from a predefined set. If a text document relates to exactly one of the 
categories, then it is called as single-label classification task; otherwise, it is 
called as multi-label classification task. For Information Retrieval (IR) and 
Machine Learning (ML), TC uses several tools and has received much 
attention in the last decades. In this paper, first classifies the text documents 
using MLP based machine learning approach (BPP) and then return the most 
relevant documents. And also describes a proposed back propagation neural 
network classifier that performs cross validation for original Neural Network.

DTIC_AD1024432,DTIC AD1024432: Perspectives on Research in Artificial Intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence Relevant to DoD,D,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is conventionally, if loosely, defined as intelligence exhibited by machines. Operationally, it can be defined as those areas of R and D practiced by computer scientists who identify with one or more of the following academic sub-disciplines: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics(including Human-Robot Interactions), Search and Planning, Multi-agent Systems, Social Media Analysis (including Crowdsourcing), and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The field of Machine Learning(ML) is a foundational basis for AI. While this is not a complete list, it captures the vast majority of AI researchers. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a research area within AI, small as measured by numbers of researchers or total funding, that seeks to build machines that can successfully perform any task that a human might do. Where AI is oriented around specific tasks, AGI seeks general cognitive abilities. On account of this ambitious goal, AGI has high visibility, disproportionate to its size or present level of success, among futurists, science fiction writers, and the public.","['dticarchive', 'additional_collections']",https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD1024432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DTIC_ADA276522,DTIC ADA276522: Incremental Recompilation for Standard ML of New Jersey,D,"Probabilistic planning methods can have various objectives: usually they either maximize the probability of goal achievement or minimize the expected execution cost of the plan, and therefore assume that the agent that executes the plan has a risk-neutral attitude. Although there are many situations where risk-sensitive behavior Is more appropriate, researchers have largely ignored the question how to incorporate risk-sensitive attitudes into their planning mechanisms. Utility theory shows that it is rational to maximize expected utility, given that the agent accepts a few simple axioms and has unlimited planning resources available. Thus, researchers might believe that one could allow for risk-sensitive attitudes by replacing all costs with their respective utilities (for an appropriate utility function). We show that this is usually not the case and, moreover, that - in general - the best action in a state can depend on the, total cost that the agent has already accumulated (that is, the Markov property does not need to hold). However, we demonstrate how one can transform planning problems for risk-sensitive agents into equivalent ones for risk-neutral agents provided that exponential utility functions are used. The transformed planning problems can then be solved with probabilistic AI planning methods or, alternatively, dynamic programming methods.","['dticarchive', 'additional_collections']",https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA276522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For purposes of brevity and clarity, the issues are treated in a highly simplified and somewhat repetitive manner. Interindustry economics, or, as it has sometimes been called, input-output analysis, is an organizational framework and tool of analysis for studying an economic system quantitatively, rigorously, and systematically. The techniques permit analysis of the econon,y as a whole and of individual products and industries simultaneouely. During the past 2 years the US intelligence community has done exploratory research in the interindustry field. This report is an examination of the role which interindustry studies can play in economic intelligence. An attempt is made to state the limitations as well as to describe the applications of interindudtry analysis in economic intelligence, but only insofar as this may be done with-out attempting to answer questions relating to the objectives, techniques, and limitations of economic intelligence in general.

Questions relating to an economy as a whole are important in economic intelligence in estimating the economic capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions of foreign powers. The basis of interindustry studies is research on the inputs and allocations (purchases and sales) of all sectors of an economy. This research results in a quantitative description of the economy in the form of tabulations showing the allocation of each producing Eector to each consuming sector (or the inputs into each consuming sector from each producing sector). The general uses of such tabulated data in economic intelligence are three: (1) direct uses in the study of products and product groups; (2) analytical uses in evaluating ecc-nomic capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions; and (3) organi-zational uses in research management. Interindustry research must necessarily be regarded as long-run cumulative research. The requirements for data are large. In many cases intelligence sources cannot provide much of the information needed. Only a slow and painstaking process of continuous research can fill the gaps. In the short run, interindustry studies contribute mainly a system or framework in which many types of quantitative eco-nomic information can be related to one another. In the long run, as the data improve and accumulate, it will be possible to undertake Lila solution of complicated problems, as, for example, to estimate the economic consequences of given sets of wartime demands on an econany. Although interindustry analysis is theoretically capable of handling a problem of this kind on a level of detail not attainable by other methods, it remains only one of several techniques of analysis available in economic intelligence. For the description and analysis of an con-omy as a whole, it supplements but does not replace the use of indi-cators, of such aggregates as gross national product and production indexes, and of material balances systems.

Conceptual Framework. The beginning of analysis with interindustry techniques is a detailed description of the economic system for an annual period. The goods and services produced in the economy are aggregated into sectors. The description indicates the transactions (purchases and sales) among these sectors. Any given sector is described both in terms of its purchases from each of the other sectors -- the input, or cost, struc-ture -- and its sales to each of the other sectors -- the use, or consumption, pattern. For the whole economy, all the transactions which took place in the given year are shown in a double-entry account-ing tabulation organized so that along the rows the use patterns of the sectors are arrayed and in the columns the input structures of the sectors are listed. The interindustry tabulation is the basic infor-mation with which analysis is performed. Analysis can be conducted either by regarding the economy as a closed circular system in which the output of all sectors is consumed by other sectors or by distinguishing between two types of sectors in order to determine the impact of changes in one group of sectors on the other sectors and on total output. The open interindustry system has been the most useful both because the assumptions it is necessary to make more nearly approach the facts than is the case with the closed system and because open interindustry system analysis offers the pos-sibility of examining a wide range of problems concerning changes in demand and technical structure. The open interindustry system distinguishes between interindus-try sectors and final demand sectors. The interindustry sectors are engaged primarily in buying from other sectors and selling to other sectors. The food-processing, chemicals, and transportation sectors are examples. These sectors buy raw materials, electric power, fuel, and other inputs and in turn sell their output to many other industries and to households. The final demand sectors consume the output of other sectors but do not produce a processed output which is sold to any other sector. Sectors usually considered to be final demand sectors are household consumption, foreign trade, government (including mili-tary) expenditures, and capital formation. The amount of research effort, the quality and quantity of data, the objective of research, and the technological and decision-making - 2 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL processes of the sectors condition the decision to place a sector in final demand. For the interindustry sectors, rigorous analysis assumes fixed technical interrelationships between inputs and outputs. The fact that such assumptions are not made for final demand sectors, in which constancy of technical interrelationships is seldom character-istic, implies that an open interindustry system is most suitable for analytical purposes. The breakdon of transactions within the economy and the nature of the interrelationships may be of varying degrees of complexity. The three major transactions categories are (1) current account, (2) capital account, and (3) interregional transactions. Technical inter-relationships are frequently assumed to be constant. If data are available, however, linear, discontinuous, or curvilinear functions can be used. Any given transaction between one sector and another may be divided into its components and tabulated along with the total. A purchase designed to meet the current operating needs of the buyer is usually the largest proportion of the total purchase by a sector. In much of interindustry analysis this transaction is the only one taken into account as a part of the interindustry system. Another segment of a purchase by a sector is that which is on capital ac-count -- purchases designed to add to capacity or to increase inventory. When analysis is performed using the relatively simple current trans-action interindustry system, capital transactions for all sectors are aggregated into separate capital formation and inventory sectors, which are usually placed in final demand. When capital transactions are Identified for each purchaser from each seller, then a double inter-industry system results. The double system is called the dynamic interindustry system. Another breakdown of transactions is to specify the region originating and the region receiving for every purchase and sale. Such an interregional interindustry system amounts to splitting the national interindustry tabulations into regional components and :Indi-cating not only the interindustry transactions but also the interspatiaa transactions. The more complicated the interindustry systems become, the more rigorous become the assumptions which it is necessary to make to perform analysis. In the simple current transactions system it fs usually assumed only that the relationships between inputs and outputs - 3 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL for all interindustry sectors are known technical functions. With a dynamic system it is assumed, in addition, that the relationships be-tween capital inputs and outputs at capacity are known technical func-tions. An interregional system involves the assumption that there is a known technical relationship between inputs and outputs region by region. The technical interrelationships are usually assumed to be fixed and constant. It is not analytically or computationally neces-sary that technical coefficients be constant. The functions may be linear, discontinuous, or curvilinear. The use of such functions, however, implies that data exist to support the described relationship. It is seldom that such data are available. Most analysis, therefore, has been driven back upon the constant coefficient assumption. Despite the possibility of undertaking quite intricate analysis with dynamic and interregional systems and notwithstanding the analyt-ical feasibility of flexible assumptions about technical interrelation-ships, the work which has been done in interindustry analysis has in fact been largely confined to the more simple current transactions system, in which the final demand sectors correspond roughly to gross national product, which includes household consumption, government expenditures, and capital formation.* The type of analysis which can be performed with an open inter-industry system is called the analysis of parametric change. Parameter is a mathematical term denoting in this case a set of values derived from a hypothetical situation. It is the purpose of analysis with an open interindustry system to trace through the economy the consequences corresponding to a given set of values. The parameters in interindustry analysis are (1) sales to final demand and (2) interrelationships among interindustry sectors embodied in the description of the structure of the economy. Changes in these elements have economic impact far beyond the immediate change. The interdependence of modern economies, as depicted in inter-industry tabulations, is such that any change in the structure or in final demand initiates a complicated round of indirect effects. Inter-industry technique is oriented toward determining quantitatively the magnitude of indirect effects on the output of all sectors. An increase of $1 million in final demand for aluminum products, for instance, results in an increased demand for all inputs feeding into * Appendix A contains a complete set of US interindustry tabulations and an explanation of their meaning. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL that sector. Aside from labor and taxes, which are charges agaimt final demand, these inputs are bauxite, alumina, electric power, chemicals, metals, and transportation. Since demand for aluminum is up, the supply sectors must expand operations and hence demand more inputs from their suppliers, and so on. These reciprocal and indirect effects are frequently small after the first round, but the cumulation of the second, third, and fourth rounds, and so on, amounts to a significant proportion of the total indirect effects. From an initial increase in final demand of $1 million worth of aluminum products there results an industrial expansion of $2.5 million, or indirec-,, effects of $1.5 million. The total expansion is divided as follows: Impact of $1 Million Worth of Aluminum Product Deliveries to Final Demand Thousand Dollars Steel Works and Rolling Mills 10 Primary Metals, n.e.c. 16 Copper Rolling and Drawing 20 Nonferrous Metal Rolling, n.e.c. 22 Primary Copper 25 Metal Mining 27 Coal and Coke 30 Wholesale Trade 37 Railroads 39 Primary Lead and Zinc 43 Petroleum Products and Crude Petroleum 47 Electric Light and Power 64 Industrial. Chemicals 111 Secondary Nonferrous Metals 252 Primary Aluminum 479 Aluminum Rolling and Drawing 1,097 Other 181 Like changes in final demand, changes in technical relation-ships start a round of indirect effects, resulting in a different level of output for all sectors. A comparison of sector output under the two situations indicates what effect the structural change has had. It also is possible to interpose side conditions and determine the consequences of the economy's operations under these conditions. Assume that the outputs of all sectors have been computed under given -5-CONFIDENTIAL  Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL conditions. Then it may be postulated that a given sector's output is a specific amount. With the new schedule of outputs, the same as before except for the one sector, a new final demand may be deter-mined. In addition, different magnitudes and mixes for final demand may be postulated, all consistent with a specific output for the given sector but with other sector outputs free to change. Within the framework of analysis of parametric change (and side conditions), it is possible to deal not only with the structure on cur-rent account but also on capital account and to take into consideration other more complicated phenamena. To do so multiplies the data require-ments, requires new assumptions, and introduces time explicitly into the analysis. While more complex in data, analysis, and interpretation, the results are in finer detail and are more precise and reveal aspects not discernible in simpler analysis. Underlying all the analysis, indeed all analysis, is a logical system. In interindustry anRlysis the logical system can be framed in mathematical terms. The mechanism of analysis follows this mathe-matical structure closely. The precise form of analytical process is not uniform, and there is no ""grand solution"" which solves all prob-lems. It is true that when the assumptions are decided upon, when all the data are in, and when no changes are foreseen, the data can be manipulated mathematically and the solution to the system (or systems) of equations implied by the interindustry structure can be obtained. This is a particularly costly procedure, and it freezes the data, classification system, and assumptions, so that even a snail change involves a repetition of the expensive solution. The usual process makes possible more flexibility in data changes (including estimates of temporal and scale changes in structure) and in the application of limiting assumptions, and it allows for detailed exRnination of specif-ic groups of sectors without much attention to other sectors. The process is called iteration, but the procedure cannot be spelled out in detail, since it changes from problem to problem. In general, iteration involves tracing a given impact through the economy by hand rather than mechanically, starting with the initial change in a sector's output, determining its impact on the sector's suppliers, then the impact on the sectors supplying these suppliers and the sectors supplying the second-round suppliers until the indirect effects are negligible. It must be remembered that the technique is not in itself a predictive device. The predictive element enters through the - 6 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL parametric changes or side conditions which are imposed on the economy. The analysis performs the function of taking these predictions and converting them into predictions of a different type. It is a vehicle for completing conditional statements of the form: ""If Y., then Y."" The ""X"" is a prediction about a change in final demand, a structural change, on a side condition. ""Then"" is the analyticaj framework by which it is possible to derive conclusion 'Y?"" which is also a prediction. ""Y"" is a schedule of sector outputs, to be com-pared with previous,outputs determined before ""X"" was specified. The technique simply carries the prediction along and reveals implications that are not clearly obvious. Since the analysis embodies information about the economy, it influences the derived prediction ""Y."" In any event, however, if ""X"" is an inaccurate forecast, then ""Y"" will in-evitably be wrong. B. Data. Grist for the interindustry analysis mill is information as to (1) the magnitude of transactions (purchases or sales) among the sectors of the economy and (2) the technical interrelationships (input coefficients) among the sectors of the economy. Transactions data can be viewed as coming from two sets of books. One set of books records all of tAe purchases of each sector from each of the other sectors.. The other set of books indicates all of the sales of each sector to each other sector. The two sets duplicate each other. A complete record of sales is also a complete record of purchases. The technical data, showing intersector relationships, consist or scattered information derived from engineering analysis. In practice, however, sectors of the economy do not keep books, data are scarce, and the information needed for interindustry analysis is limited and difficult to obtain. Generally, there are three sources which form the empirical basis for interindustry analysis: (1) statistical records, (2) engineering and technical data, and (3) information derived from sam-ples. Statistical record information is the most important. Ir, the UB and many other countries, such data are based ultimately upon records kept by individual firms. The data are compiled and made available through census and survey reports (Census of Manufactures, Minerals Yearbook, and others in the US), publications of trade end industrial associations, and directly from the production and account-ing statements of the firm. - 7 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL Engineering and technical data are available in many published engineering analyses to be found in textbooks, manuals, and specialized periodicals. It is possible in many cases to undertake research in-vestigations making use of engineering methods to develop information on industrial interrelationships. Techniques of Sampling make it possible, by interviews and questionnaires, to obtain information about the whole from limited data about its parts. Samples of recorded information, where the whole body of data is large, have also proved useful. The three principal empirical sources provide the underlying data required to piece together a complete quantitative description of the structure of the economy. The sources of data are not inde-pendent, and none by itself is adequate. They combine to form the description of economic structure on which subsequent analysis is based. The data required for interindustry studies are more detailed than the data needed for most economic analysis. The minute detail of data for interindustry purposes gives rise to a greater chance for error. Much economic analysis makes use of more highly aggregated data, in which small errors are canceled out, whereas in interindustry analysis every error is fully reflected in the results. In other economic analysis, greater reliability also can be achieved because more attention can be given to each part of aggregated data. The data used in interindustry work have not been notably accurate. Census information, sampling, and some engineering coeffi-cients have gone into the construction of existing interindustry tabulations. Despite the fact that a great amount of data has been accirrmilated and that zompetent analysts have been working with the data over a period of years, there is still much to be desired. Weaknesses In data and lack of data have been the major stumbling blocks to successful analysis. One of the most important analytical uses of interindustry studies is as a study of the implications of changes in external demands on the economy. These changes are based ultimately on peace or war strategy !gra tactics, technological innovations, weapons systems and defense measures, and decisions of investors and consumers. These considerations must be reduced to quantitative economic terms which are consistent with the description of economic and industrial structure. The data involved in hypothetical changes are no less important than the data on economic structure, although the former - 8 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL are frequently neglected. Estimates and, often, guesses substitute for a careful derivation of the economic quantities implied in a change in strategy. If the data specifying the change are not accurate. the conclusions will be amiss. C. Uses. The uses of interindustry analysis have already been implied in the types of analysis which can be undertaken. The great single analytical use is the determination of indirect effects of a charge in final demand, sector output, or the structure of the economy, or in some combination of these. A knowledge of these facts is useful not only in itself but also as an aid in the analysis of the operation of the economy. Several broad classes of uses may be enumerated: (1) national security, (2) national welfare, (3) technological innovation, (4) market and sales research, and (5) economic intelligence. In of the uses, variations and combinations of types of analysis can be used. In addition to the analytical uses mentioned above, interindus-try studies provide a valuable consistency check and confirmation for estimates derived from national accounts (such as industrial production indexes and gross national product) and are a starting point for anal-ysis along other lines or of separate sectors. These auxiliary ana-lytical uses are in some cases as valuable as the analysis of parametric change. For instance, analysis of the relationship between the con-struction industry and other industries in the US has revealed serious errors in data on construction activity. The organizational system implied in interindustry analyris is one of its most significant contributions. The use of a detailed coded classification system in which each sector is rigorously defined makes it possible to organize the data, documentation, and methods of estimation in an orderly manner and provides a means both for con-tinual accretion to data and for checking their consistency on a continuing basis. D. Limitations. The limitations of any technique of analysis result from (1) failure of assumptions to approximate actual conditions, (2) inade-quate or improper formulation of the hypothesis, (3) weakness in and - 9 - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL lack of data, (4) errors in inference, and (5) inaccurate and inade-quate interpretation of the results. Economic analysis has advanced to the point where logical flaws in inference are rare. The basic formulation of the hypothesis in interindustry analysis is sound. Granting its assumptions, interindus-try analysis has been demonstrated to be logically accurate. Even so, however, it can be misused, and care must be exercised to see that the formulation is correct and the inferences are carefully. drawn. The other limitations, those arising from assumptions, data, and interpretation, impose a heavy obligation on those undertaking the analysis. The limitations are such that no precise statement can be made as to the magnitude of error introduced by any of them sepa-rately or by the three combined. Generalization as to direction and magnitude of error cannot be made. If a datum is wrong, it is reflect-ed in the results. If an assumption is inaccurate, the conclusions will be biased. If an interpretation is not appropriate, the purpose of the analysis is defeated. Precisely the same conditions obtain for any other form of analysis. If there is a difference between inter-industry and any other kind of analysis in this respect, it results from the facts (1) that the assumptions are more specific and compre-hensive, (2) that more detailed data are involved, and (3) that inter-pretation is more complex. Each of these may allow error to intrude. Two particular considerations are especially troublesome. One is the frequent assumption that the input per unit output is fixed for all ranges of output. The other is the possibility that the errors in data are so large that they are as large as, or larger than, the in-direct effects which are the major reason for undertaking the analysis in the first place. These limitations cannot be dismissed and must be constantly kept in mind. Extreme care must be maintained to see that the limiting assumptions, especially those involving fixed coefficients, are handled so that conclusions are not impaired. The process of iter-ation mitigates in some degree the fixed coefficient assumptions, since by means of this process the coefficients may be changed to reflect temporal, scalar, and structural changes. Even so, analysis necessar-ily proceeds on the basis of assumed technological rigidities which are frequently at odds with actual events, and the limitation must always be considered. Data weaknesses are often so great that one has no confidence that, a particular indirect effect may be twice as much or only half that, resulting from analysis. The errors may be greater than the indirect effects. The hazard is increased by the fact that it is not possible to determine where weaknesses in data have vitiated the results. The data are intermingled to such an ex-tent that it is almost, impossible to untangle them and find where a CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL poor datum has influenced the results adversely. Nothing can substi-tute for data. Where data are weak or are lacking, the results of any analysis based upon them are correspondingly weakened. There are no ""tricks"" to get around this limitation. Only data improvement through arduous and assiduous research can raise the level of analysis. E. Evaluation. It is still t90 early to offer a definitive evaluation of interindustry techniques. No one questions that interindustry analy-sis has some capabilities not possessed by other forms of analys-is; that it is a flexible and powerful tool of economic analysis, and that, used judiciously, it is a valuable analytic framework for many quan-titative economic problems. So far, however, interindustry analysis cannot be said to have been tested and proved as an accurate predic-tive device in the comprehensive detail which it implies. In a literal sense, interindustry analysis cannot be ""tested."" It can be compared, and its consistency can be checked internally. Prediction resulting from analysis can be compared with realized re-sults, but this operation tests the techniques only in part, since the real predictive element is apart -- that is, independent of he analytical technique. The basis for judgment of analytical results is the corres-pondence of the data with the facts and the correspondence of the assumptions with the operational procedures. When these conditions hold, analytical results can be counted upon as reliable. ""Good"" and ""bad"" are misnomers when applied to internally consistent theo-retical frameworks. Such frameworks may be useful or not useful for purposes of solving particular research problems. A tentative favor-able evaluation can be given interindustry analysis. II. Economic Intelligence and Interindustry Studies.* A. Nature of Intelligence Data. Economic intelligence data having a bearing on the operamions of the economy of foreign powers are of three general kinds: direct intelligence, derived intelligence, and analogous data. Direct economic intelligence data are relatively scarce. Two kinds of direct intelligence are available. The first consists of official statements and the second is classified information obtained * Appendix B outlines some of the work which has been done along interindustry lines in the intelligence community. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL from Observation, documents, and other sources. Both of these kinds of data are spotty and inadequate. In addition, the data are of uneven quality and reliability. Derived intelligence is that information which can be inferred from what is known directly. The basis of the derivation may be the complementarity of industrial products, technology, or many other situations in which an unknown quantity may be deduced from known quantities. Analogous information is that body of data known and available for some country other than the foreign power under study which 2an be used to fill gaps in direct and derived intelligence. Information concerning the US economy, because of its abundance and ease of acquisition, has become the standard analogy. Any research effort, including interindustry research, must necessarily make use of all three kinds of d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ta and data from all sources. The combination cannot be known in advance. Ideally, direct intelligence should be the empirical backbone of any research, with derived intelligence providing the primary support data. Analogous information, if used at all, should be used sparingly and only to fill gaps which must necessarily be filled. In interindustry research, because of the detail required, the weighting of various kinds of data is often quite the opposite of the ideal. In order to complete a systematic study of the economic structure of the USSR, it is necessary to borrow extensively from US information on technological interrelationships. Direct intelligence and derived intelligence are important in establishing the control totals and for some of the estimates of inputs and allocations. At the very best the data used in interindustry research are of questionable reliability. In some cases it is possible to assign error limits for individual figures, such as the production. of a single product. But when this estimate is aggregated with other such figures having differing reliability and with some data on US industry, it becomes difficult to assess the reliability of the final figure. Weaknesses in data and lack of data are the most serious prob-lems in interindustry analysis of foreign powers. Accurate data are mixed with the less accuraLe, and the final tabulation, because - 12-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL of aggregation and forcing to fit the control totals, has a mixed quality without any way to identify the more from the less reliabie. Since the technique is oriented to revealing indirect eff3cts, the data weaknesses may result in a situation in which the error limits are as much as, or greater than, the indicated effect. In this case the actual indirect effect may be half or twice as much as that indicated. There is no way out of the dilemma. The deleterious effects of inadequate data can be mitigated in some measure._ The only satisfactory remedy is to raise the level of confidence in tie data by continuous research.* B. Direct Use of Data. Interindustry research serves several important uses in eco-nomic intelligence. Not the least among these uses is the direct use of the data in industry and product description. The cost structire and use pattern of an individual product are an integral part of interindustry analysis, and they are also of considerable intelligence value in and of themselves. Alone or in combination with other data, interindustry tabulations can form the frame of reference for analysis of products, product groups, and large sectors of the economy. Nearly all sector and product studies have as a part of their research effort the estimate of output, of some critical inputs, of major end uses of the item, and of possible substitutes. These data are substantially the same as those needed in interindustry analysis. Hence a double purpose is served in working up these data: direct use in sector studies and use as a part of interindustry studies. C. Analytical Uses. 1. Analysis of Parametric Changes. The most significant area of analysis is that of deter-mining the implications of changes in the economy which affect th sector outputs. A parameter is an element in the economy which is fixed for any postulated situation but which may change as the postu-lated situation changes. The parameters are (a) allocation of sector outputs to final demand, (b) the input-output coefficient for partic-ular sectors, and, in special cases, (c) the output of specific sectors. These three elements are fixed for any given time period * Appendix C is an outline of procedures which can be used in the construction of interindustry tabulations for the USSR. -13-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL under a given set of conditions. Analysis proceeds on the basis of postulating changes in any one of them and working out the implica-tion of these postulated changes. a. Final Demand. There are innumerable examples of changes in final demand. From the point of view of economic intelligence, the most important examples are analyses of mobilization and war demands to determine the capability of a foreign power to support the demands of such action. Interindustry techniques are particularly valuable for such an evaluation, since this type of analysis is explicitly designed to bring out the indirect requirements of a military program and economic mobilization for war. For instance, a direct requirement for aluminum products by the military services might be easily within the economy's capabilities. But in order to attain the higher level of demand, 150 percent more aluminum products are required and other vital sectors have a heavy expansion burden placed upon them. Levy of a complete schedule of mobilization and war requirements resulting from the expansion of supporting sectors of the economy may make the difference between the ability of the economy to meet the new demands or the necessity of cutting back important sectors. The analysts of mobilization and war demands inserts a new element of uncertainty. The data on direct requirements, which become a part of final demand, and data on cutbacks and shifts in con-sumption and investment are hypothetical. But these data must reflect accurately the postulated conditions, or the analysis becomes a simple exercise in logic. The demands of the war machine must be quantified and tabulated in terms of the sectors of the economy analyzed. This involves a conversion from specific end products, such as tanks and aircraft, into steel and aluminum products. The consumption sector must be analyzed to determine the extent of cutbacks which it can endure. The composition of the investment sector will shift, and it may be reduced. The demands of these sectors must be quantified. When all of the. relevant data are assembled, they may be analyzed with interindustry techniques. The implication of the new final demands may be traced through by the iteration process, singly and/or collectively. As a result of the new amends, new direct plus new indirect requirements must be met sector by sector. These new required outputs must then CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL be matched with independent intelligence estimates of maximum output and capacity of each sector. These estimates inject another element of error which can vitiate the results of the analysis. A single estimate for mobilization and war demands is not sufficient. Several sets of hypothetical final demands can be analyzed and their implications traced. Each set is pre-sumed to represent different circumstances. In this way an array of estimates of capabilities can be made. The elements of strength in interindustry analysis of mobilization and war programs lie in its ability to determine indirect requirements for each sector of the economy, thus showing the total impact of demand. The weakness of interindustry analysis lies primarily in its requirements for data. The data which form the basic structure of the economy may well be subject to considerable error. Military, investment, and consumer demand cannot be determined accurately in many cases. In the verification procedure, independent estimates of capacity may be in error. Errors introduced by the data may be so great as to undo the benefits to be derived from the calculation of indirect effects. No precise assessment of reliability is possible; only a gradual improvement of the data can be counted upon to tmproye reliability and reduce uncertainty. Within the framework of interindustry analysis it is possible, given the data, to become much more sophisticated than is Indicated above. For instance, a flow interindustry system can be coupled to a consumption-investment-military final demand. Using this basic framework, the new final demand allocations can be fed in by quarters and direct and indirect requirements can be calculated by quarters. Proper accounting can be made for lead times by this process. Furthermore, by expanding the simple flow system into a flow and capital-capacity system it is possible to bring the capital requirements explicitly into consideration. Interregional trans-actions can also be considered. Both require additional data and additional assumptions. At the present time, refinement of the flow (or current transaction) interindustry system for intelligence pur-poses is not practicable. b. Interdiction. A second area of analysis is the problem of inter-diction. The foreign trade transactions of the economy are generally -15-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL considered a part of final demand. Elimination of imports and exports in whole or in part constitutes interdiction; but, since they are in final demand, the implications for the rest of the economy may be traced out as indicated above. Another use, perhaps more important for the intelligence community, is that of determining the effects of air damage on the economy. An air strike would reduce capacity and ? hence output in many sectors. By fixing the output of those sectors which have been damaged at a specific level and treating the other sector outputs as fixed at the same level as before the air strike,#NAME?, and no single solution has any more merit than another, since there are many possible ways to adjust to a reduction in output for one or more sectors. Because of the lack of a unique solution, the inter-pretation of results of an analysis of interdiction is especially difficult. The limitations of data are another serious obstacle to this type of analysis. Even so, the interdependence of the economy makes it important that interdiction problems be analyzed by techniques in which this characteristic is explicit. For instance, suppose damage to the aluminum products sector reduced output by 50 percent. If the interindustrial requirements are 50 percent or more, there will be no deliveries to final demand unless sector outputs are reshuffled so that aluminum-demanding interindustry sectors reduce their output and hence their consumption of aluminum products. Only with a general interdependence schema is it possible to determine the full impact of interdiction. c. Structural Change. The third area of analysis is the consideration of structural change. Although this problem is conceptually separate, it is in fact usually coupled with changes in final demand and inter-diction. The basic descriptive data -- the input per unit output for all sectors -- are usually assumed to be fixed for analytical purposes. The coefficients are presumed to reflect technological necessity, and it is on this assumption that most analysis, including that discussed above, is based. Using the iterative process, however, it is not -16-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL necessary to adhere slavishly to this assumption. The coefficients may be changed to reflect the changed conditions. The analysis of structural change, whether as a problem in itself or as a part of the analysis of war or mobilization or interdiction, implies that there are data concerning such struc-tural changes. In reality this is seldom the case, for most of the structural changes are hypothetical with an empirical base limited to analogous information about the US economic structure. Despite this, structural change, however it arises, is of sufficient magnitude that it must be taken into account. The three types of analysis collectively would repre-sent the ideal analysis of capabilities. For instance, in a hypothetical war situation the economy must bear the demands of mobilization and com-bat and at the same time sustain foreign trade interdiction, subs-antial air damage, and loss (or gain) of territory. While adjusting to -,hese severe conditions, the economy would undergo a series of structural changes. Realistic postulates for all three circumstances and a re-liable structure of the economy would make possible more detailed estimates of capabilities than heretofore possible. 2. Ancillary Analytical Uses. A number of ancillary analytical purposes can also be served by interindustry studies. Analysis by means of national aggregates also suffers from weak and insufficient data, and inter-industry studies offer an independent method of building up these national aggregates. The relationship between particular production estimates and aggregates has been incompletely explored, and inter-industry analysis offers some hope for the integration of indicat)rs with aggregative analysis. Interindustry analysis, expressed in a numeraire, is In opportunity for a systematic study of prices and the relationship of prices to real costs. Such cost analysis is valuable not only in that it points to the drain of a given sector on the allocation c:P' materials to alternative uses but also as a weightinv system for Lhe construction of index numbers for the economy as a whole and for various components. No precise outline can be made of all the ancillary analytical uses of interindustry stvidies. Many such uses are -17-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL confirmatory in nature, and they tend to buttress analysis of different kinds by providing both a confirmation of results and data from a new source. Other analytical uses, such as examination of prices and costs, break new ground. It is quite possible that the ancillary ana-lytical uses will prove, at least in the short run, much more valuable than the direct analytical application for which interindustry studies are specifically designed. D. Organizational Uses. While the ultimate aim of interindustry studies is analysis, there are within the process many benefits to be derived by looking at the economy as a double entry accounting system and organizing the data is such a manner that economic interdependence is revealed. One of the most significant of these organizational uses is its educational value. In a research effort organized largely along functional lines it is all too easy to concentrate upon particular products and industries to the relative neglect of the over-all economy. The interindustry approach, by putting the economy and all its compo-nents into perspective, enables one to grasp details simultaneously with the over-all situation. At a glance the complicated industrial interrelationships are revealed, while at the same time the over-all functioning of the economy can be comprehended. Since interindustry analysis depends upon a cross referencing of costs and shipments of each sector and its components, the aproach naturally leads to a filing system in which all of the information about the economy can be conveniently and logically placed. The inter-industry tabulatiOn itself is, in fact, a filing system. Behind the tabulation lies a more complicated set of files which encompasses all relevant data, such as prices, production (in heterogeneous units), technical interrelationships, cost and shipment data, and other such information. The interindustry file is not static; it is a constantly growing, changing compilation of data. It is arranged in such a manner that there are continual accretions to the base fund of knowledge of the structure of the economy. New data can be added so that they have an immediate impact on the final tabulation; better data replace the old, and more or less comprehensive information fits into the filing system in such a way that the improvement in results is immediate. This implies that no interindustry tabulation is final. For a specific CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 CONFIDENTIAL purpose, a tabulation can be drawn out of the files, assembled, reconciled, and used. At another time, for another purpose, another tabulation can be developed in the same manner. Thus the interindus-try file, a continuing and gradually improving body of data, stands ready on short notice to support a capabilities estimate with the latest data available. The filing system implied in the interindustry approach makes possible another important organizational use. This is in the test-ing of the reliabinty of data and checking their consistency. When the data have been assembled, it is possible to evaluate their reli-ability by comparing them with other data. Every sale of a product is also a cost to some sector, and every input is a part of a sector's output. Hence the data can be checked and cross-checked. Data which are inconsistent can be weeded out, and the general level of reliabil-ity can be raised. New information can be compared with existing data, and the relative merits of each can be assessed. Finally, the interindustry approach provides a guide to further research not only along interindustry lines but also in other methods. Gaps in the data can be spotted readily, and steps can be taken to remedy them. If price information for a particular group of products, or production data for some sector, or any other information is n6eded, the technique, backed by its organizational system, makes it possible to detect the missing elements. It may become clear, because of weak-ness of data, that some types of analysis cannot be undertaken but that other kinds of analysis can be profitably expanded or that other techniques should be exploited. These applications of interindustry studies -- direct use of data, analysis, and improved organization -- must be regarded as a whole and none slighted. They complement one another. The tendency might be to get on with the analytical uses and neglect the other uses. This would be dangerous. The technique is one which improves with age; the analytical stage, particularly the analysis of para-metric change, may well be several years in the future. This is riot only because the pilot stages of research are expensive and ineffi-cient but also because data exploitation and preparation, both for the interindustry and final demand sectors, are difficult and tim-consuming activities. To ignore the direct use of data by all re-searchers and to neglect other analytical uses and the benefits to be derived from improved organization would be to fail to use the framework of interindustry techniques to its fullest extent. -19-CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP79S01046A000100030007-1 UNCLASSIFIED  APPENDIX A US INTERINDUSTRY TABULATIONS Interindustry tabulations for the US economy were prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1947. The complete tabulation is in terms of 450 industries. Tables 1,2, and 3 which follow in this appendix are an aggregation of the more extensive study.* 1. Transactions Matrix. Table 1, Interindustry Flow of Goods and Services by Industry of Origin and Destination,1947, is the transactions matrix and gives the basic transactions information. Each row shows the uses to cihich the total output) given in the last column, was put in 1947 in terms of the 50 consuming categories. Each column lists all of the inyuts from the 50 producing industries into the industry listed in that column. By definition, total costs (Total Gross Outlays) and total sales (Total Gross Output) are the same. The classification system splits the economy into 44 interindustry sectors and 6 final demand sectors. The latter include new and maintenance construction,** gross private capital formation, households, government, exports, and inventory changes. The transactions matrix is a description of the economy in 1947 and by itself has only descriptive uses. The use pattern of each industry in a systematic classification system is available at a glance. The cost structure of each industry is likewise readily seen in the table. * Tables 1,2, and 3 follow p. 22.

Coefficients Matrix. In order to convert the information into a form usable for analyt-ical purposes, it is necessary to specify the relationship between input and output for each sector of the economy. This is done in Table 2, Direct Purchases per Dollar of Output, 1947. To get to Table 2 from Table 1, it is necessary to divide a given column by the Total Gross Outlays (equals Total Gross Output) for the given sector. To get the coefficients in the Nonferrous Metals sector, for example, it is nec-essary to divide each figure in that column by $6,387,0,000. The same operation for each column determines Table 2, which is the coefficients matrix. In the process the final demand sectors are dropped out, inasmuch as coefficients for these sectors are not needed. The coefficients matrix is usable directly in the iteration process. Successive multiplications of coefficients will determine the first-round effects, the second-round effects, the third-round effects, and so on, until, after innumerable such calculations, the total indirect effects of a change can be computed. 3. Inverse Matrix. A solution to the entire system of equations is given in Table 3, Direct and Indirect Requirements per Dollar of Final Demand, 1947. Both direct and indirect effects are determined simultaneously in this table. For instance, $1 of final demand for Agriculture and Fisheries results in a demand of $1.41 increased output of Agriculture and Fisheries, of $0.10 for Food and Kindred Products, of $0.05 for Chemicals, and the same for Stone, Clay, and Glass. The total impact of the delivery of $1 worth of goods to Agriculture and Fisheries, as can be determined by summing over the entire row, is an expansion of all output to $1.98, nearly double the initial change. ' Many examples may be shown. For instance, the delivery. of $1 worth of Motor Vehicles to final demand requires Iron and Steel to expand $0.24; Nonferrous Metals, $0.08; Other Fabricated Metal Products, $0.12; and Chemicals, $0.06. The delivery of $1 worth of Iron and Steel to final demand requires an expansion of $0.18 in Products of Petroleum and Coal, $0.07 in Railroad Transportation, and $0.09 in Scrap and Miscellaneous Industries.

GDC2015Hill,"GDC 2015: Ben Sunshine-Hill - ""Applying Machine Learning Like a Responsible Adult""",Unknown Author,"Game AI developers tend to treat machine learning with a mixture of 
curiosity, skepticism and dismissal. There's a widespread perception 
that certain unique aspects of game AI make it a poor fit for ML. 
However, game AI is far from unique in its needs. The generally bad 
experiences game AI has had with ML are primarily due to a lack of 
knowledge about the necessary tools and techniques rather than a failing
 of the technique itself. Simply understanding these tools and 
techniques, however, often helps game devs get beyond the suspicion and 
reluctance and use machine learning techniques to improve their games. 
This lecture will describe key concepts from ML, such as over-fitting 
and the bias/variance tradeoff, and the problem spaces 
(supervised/unsupervised, classification versus regression, etc.). We 
will then give a quick overview of several common and valuable ML 
algorithms.

However, the complexity nature of IoT systems and the exponential amount of data collected and exchanged between Things relieve a big challenge in terms of security and privacy. Implementing classical security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices is no more effective against sophisticated Cyber-attacks. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Blockchain can be leveraged to enhance the security of IoT and deal with its various problems. In this paper, we will describe the IoT technology and its domain of application, the protocols used to communicate between smart devices, security issues and existing AI solution.</span>","['ijaers', 'folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']",https://archive.org/details/ijaers-35-june-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this research, the use of supervised instance selection (SIS) to improve the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in classification is investigated. The goal of SIS is to enhance the accuracy of future classification tasks by identifying and selecting a subset of examples from the original dataset. The purpose of this research is to provide light on how useful SIS is as a preprocessing tool for artificial neural network-based classification. The work aims to improve the input dataset to ANNs by using SIS, which may help with problems caused by noisy or redundant data.

However, the perception of information technology (IT) professionals about the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with ERP cloud service platforms is unknown. Few studies have examined how leaders can implement AI for strategic management, but no study has qualitatively explored AIs integration in the cloud ERP system. This qualitative phenomenological study explored IT professionals’ perceptions regarding the integration of AI and Supervised-machine (S-machine) learning into cloud service platforms in the enhancement of the cloud ERP system. Two research questions were developed for this study: 1) What are the perceptions of IT professionals regarding the use of an AI model to integrate SaaS and ERP? and 2) What are the perceptions of IT professionals regarding how AI can be integrated in order to enhance the security of using an ERP cloud-based system? Through a hermeneutical lens and a focus on integrating the Application Programming Interface (API), purposive sampling was used to interview five AI experts, three Machine Learning (ML) experts, five Cybersecurity experts, and two Cloud Service Providers provided their lived experiences with AI and S-machine learning. Five main themes emerged, including 1) use of an AI model to integrate SaaS and ERP helped perform work efficiently, 2) challenges for integrating AI into cloud service ERP and SaaS, 3) resources needed to fully implement an AI into cloud-service ERP or SaaS, 4) the best practices for developing and implementing an AI model for ERP and SaaS, and 5) how security of an ERP clouds-based system is optimized by integrating AI. The culmination of these findings has positive implications for individuals and organizations to improve management performance. While this study does not proposal a new theory, this study extends current literature on the application of theories related to technology integration.</span>","['ijaers', 'folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']",https://archive.org/details/ijeec-01-march-april-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
